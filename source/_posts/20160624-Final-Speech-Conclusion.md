We oppose the policy which will allow all couples to have two children from the beginning of 2016.

# Population 

China has the world’s largest population at 1.37 billion. The United Nations projects the number of Chinese people over the age of 65 will jump 85% to 243 million by 2030, up from 131 million this year. The graying population will burden health care and social services, and the world's second-largest economy will struggle to maintain its growth. The people in China are in extreme poverty, mass amounts of people are suffering and dying because of it. This policy will make this situation more serious. If the population was that large, our Natural Resources would be much smaller and most plants and animals humans use for their everyday diets could wipe out off the face of the Earth.

# Economic Welfare and support

Meanwhile, couples in areas like Anhui or Shandong who supply much of the labor that powers China’s labor-intensive industries are more likely to have more than one child – but gauging exactly how much material support and through what channels that support should be offered is unclear. The cost of having a second child can be so prohibitive that some couples who would otherwise want to raise two children may not be able to afford to.

China is sometimes compared with Japan, where economic problems have in part stemmed from demographic trends. Also , The upcoming Lunar New Year, which begins in February, marks the Year of the Sheep in the Chinese Zodiac; "sheep babies" are traditionally believed to be meek and encounter bad luck.


# Costly to raise two children

Raising only a child is already taking up a very significant part of the expenses. aving another baby would bring much more financial obligations for example, it will cost more for their education, housing, and such. Taking care of only one child is very energy-consuming for the two of our parents.

# Relationship Between Children and Parents

It just need to deal with the relationship between the child and parents properly in the first few years and to help them to adapt to the social life in the future. But parents of the family with more than one child need to handle with the competition and conflicts among all family members , so the effort parents spent is doubled. 

# Taking Care of parents

Research shows that parents' responsibility to take care of children often falls mainly on the one shoulder, and if the child has not been supported by other brothers or sisters , this child is easy to feel frustrated and helpless [2,3]. This negative emotions caused by too much responsibility of taking care of their parents mainly falling on someone’s shoulder, sometimes hinder contact between brothers and sisters, even made primary caregivers to seek help from a legal perspective [4].

# Psychologic

Moreover, the sense of the shortage of resources often continue into adulthood, it will affect all aspects of work and marriage of an adult.

# Advantages of only child

These children, because of their parents' emotional needs for a more rapid response, have a higher sense of security and became more confident. In addition, comparing with the siblings of the child, the only child is going to have more opportunities to participate in the activities with adults, and will have more verbal communication with parents and other adults, so they mature faster. There's research shows that one-child families get more resources, such as more toys and books, better kindergartens and schools. They also got better grades in school.

# No Difference Comparing with the family with more than one child

US researchers’ study published on "Marriage and Family"  in 1987 shows that there’s no significant differences in sixteen personality traits between “the family with only one child” and “the family with more than one child”, including leadership, maturity, extraversion , the degree of social integration, popularity, generosity, cooperation, flexibility, emotional stability. Moreover, this study also found that the only child develops more fast than the child in the family with many children. For example, they are on the higher level of achievement motivation and with higher IQ . In addition, these children also show a higher level of self-esteem.


# Women’s Rights

I have seen a lot of women's rights arguments being thrown around. I am a strong supporter of feminism, but I ask you this, how can you argue that the unborn children should be treated equally to the already born children who are suffering due to population. How can you say that the children who are unborn have the equal rights to free education and healthcare than the already born children who are living in such poverty they can not afford this.


# Conclusion

Each birth is less space, less food, and a depletion of quality of life. It's easy to argue that this policy should be abolished. We are in China Mainland, which can be one of the most crowded areas in the world. At this time how to ensure the old can have a quiet and comfortable life at an old age, making them not to worry about their life, it will be our last but the most difficult battle.


# C.Changer 's Lead in

Since the two-child policy was published, the controversy about whether it should be released has never stopped. We strongly oppose two-child policy. China now has a lot of problems, but most of the problems are caused by the large population base. We are developing the market economy, which means that we will have a capital accumulation and extra populations. With a large population born in 1960's, China's population cannot be ignored. Experts are trying to use the two-child policy to solve the problems, but it just does not help. They think it may help solving the aging of population, ecological pollutions, waste of resources and many other problems which were mostly caused by the large populations of China.
But the two-child policy is only making it worse. On the one hand, if more children are born in the society, government must pay more to deal with the educational expenses, which means a lot of money. Severe employment situation will be even worse, a lot of people can’t get a job even they don't like it. National social spending will continue to rise. Downward trend in the economy will cause more unemployed populations. On the other hand, life of the old cannot be guaranteed because of the huge burden on national finances. Then the population growth inertia will produce extra populations, which means more waste of resources and more ecological pollutions. Gradually, food and fresh water resources will reduce. More children will be born to solve the problems. If it occurs again and again, China will be worn down sooner or later.
